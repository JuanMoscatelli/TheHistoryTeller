                    <p>
                        Wilmington, Delaware — President Trump and his allies have launched a late effort to again tarnish Joe Biden by tying him to his son Hunter Biden's overseas business interests, publicizing emails and photos supposedly from a laptop alleged to have been abandoned by the younger Biden and timing their release in a manner reminiscent of Russia's efforts to dump damaging material about Hillary Clinton in 2016.

                        At the Drug Enforcement Administration's Training Academy in Virginia last year, an instructor on the firing range called out a name that was shared by two trainees, one Black and one white. When both responded, the white instructor clarified, "I meant the monkey."

                        Don't expect much of a winter wallop this year, except for the pain of worsening drought, U.S. government forecasters said Thursday. Two-thirds of the United States should get a warmer than normal winter, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration predicted.

                        Former Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson was accused of sexual harassment and assault on Thursday in a lawsuit filed by an officer who says she served as his personal driver. The lawsuit accuses Johnson, who was the highest ranking member of the department at the time, of "shockingly violent, abusive, and harassing conduct" that included multiple instances of forced oral and vaginal sex.
